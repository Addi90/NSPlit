# NSPlit
A GUI tool to split .nsp files into parts sized for the FAT32 Filesystem, since this only is able to handle files of a maximum size of 4GB. The splitted parts are copied into a newly made folder by this tool. The save-location of that folder can be chosen via the GUI. The newly created folder can then be copied over to the FAT32 filesystem.
